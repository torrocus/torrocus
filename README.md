### Coding Philosophy 📜

1. I **analyze** the problem and break it down. I split larger problems
   into smaller sub-problems, sometimes even atomic steps.
2. I **plan** and act in iterations. I adhere to the principle
   that 10 minutes of planning saves an hour of work.
3. I prioritize **communication**. I emphasize code readability
   as a key element of team communication.
4. I write **tests**. Testing is my foundation to ensure correctness
   and high quality.
5. I **automate** processes. I am human and make mistakes, and to avoid them,
   I rely on automation.
6. I standardize code. I use **linters** and shared formatting standards
   to unify team work.
7. I avoid commenting, remove unnecessary code. **Less code** is easier
   to maintain, and code that doesn't exist contains no bugs.
